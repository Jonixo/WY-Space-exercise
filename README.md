# WY Space Exercise
A simple exercise given by Telepazio VEGA Deutschland.


There are two ways to run this project;

1-) Clone/download project, open in any IDE and run it.

2-) Go to "WY-Space-exercise\out\artifacts\WYSpaceExercise_jar" file and you will find .jar file and .bat file. Double click on bat file. Console will open and ask 
for ground station bandwidth to compare it to max downlink.

To change the txt input you need to name it "pass-schedule.txt" since its somewhat hard coded (It wasn't a requirement).,



Example input: 50 <br />
Example output: "Maximum amount of downlink is: 50 and ground station's bandwidth is: 52. Ground station can handle this downlink."

Example input: 63 <br />
Example output: "Maximum amount of downlink is: 63 and ground station's bandwidth is: 52. Ground station can't handle this downlink."
